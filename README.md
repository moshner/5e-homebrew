## Approved Homebrew Rules

### Buying Magic Ammunition
Magical ammunition such as arrows or bolts can be obtained at 50 for full value based on rarity leve. So 50 +1 Arrows would cost 1d6x100gp as per the [DMG's magic item price guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#BuyingaMagicItem).

This is different than paying 1/2 price for only one arrow or bolt.

### Buying Potions/Oils
Magical consumables other than ammunition cost 1/10 the magic item cost instead of 1/2 as listed in the [DMG's magic item price guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#BuyingaMagicItem).
